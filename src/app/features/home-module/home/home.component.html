      <h2>Why
        <span class="gcolor">
          Comply</span>?

      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="right-comply">
      <p>When running a business, whether it is an SMB, or a large enterprise, one of the basic requirements is 100% compliance with the law. In complex jurisdictions, this can be a very daunting task! In India alone, there are over <span class="gcolor">76,000 </span> possible annual statutory compliance laws in 2019.</p>

      <p>You have to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>determine which among this myriad of laws apply to you</li>
      <li>keep track of all the legal updates and notifications</li>
      <li>make sure that you conform to the law in letter and spirit</li>
      <li>and of course, always be ready for compliance audits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of this just distracts you from your core focus – your business.</p>



      <p>Being non-compliant also does the same thing. If the associated penalties for non-compliance are not enough of a deterrent, the consequences to your senior management, and&nbsp; the wasted hours filing a large amount of paperwork to remedy these non-compliances, should be!</p>
